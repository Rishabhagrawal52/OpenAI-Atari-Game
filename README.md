<h3>Getting Started with Gym</h3>
<b>Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.</b><p>Openai is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano.</p>
<br>
<p>The gym library is a collection of test problems — environments — that you can use to work out your reinforcement learning algorithms. These environments have a shared interface, allowing you to write general algorithms.<p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To get started, you’ll need to have Python 3.5+ installed. Simply install gym using pip:</p>

```bash
pip install gym
```

<h2>Installing using Git</h2>
<p>If you prefer, you can also clone the gym Git repository directly.</p>


```bash

git clone https://github.com/openai/gym
cd gym
pip install -e .

```

<p>once we install openai we'll be able to get started with openai. Openai provides us with mainly OpenAI Gym.
  OpenAI provides us with different environments that we can use to implement reinforcement learning.

Into These environments we can develop what is called Atari Games.


These environments require additional dependencies

<b>once Installed OpenAI Gym the rest work is done using Jupyter Notebook</p>
